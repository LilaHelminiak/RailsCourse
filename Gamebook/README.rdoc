Changes from the last update:

1. Added character model that belongs to the user. 
- When the user is signing up then (s)he can add information about his character that (s)he's gonna play with.
- When user is logged in then (s)he has possibility to check character details on 'View your character' page
- Access to other character pages are disabled

2. Added coffescript to preview changes of edited article
- When admin edits an existing article then (s)he can preview the changes, e.g. all '[ ]' will be changed to a radio button.
 Notes:
 - coffee script does not work on heroku, I'm investigating it. The script can be found in app/assets/javascript/articles.js.coffee
 - I'm thinking of adding new model, answers.
   Article has_many answers and each answer will lead to another article. 
   That seems to be better approach than keeping an article with all answers and links in simple article_text.
